<br>
* Remember its IP address as you'll need to
enter it as shown in the image above.
<br><br>
Press the Save button after entering your IP
<br><br>
You shouldn't really need to use the power button as most Rokus
will turn on when the input receives power from the TV.
However it may be useful for turning the Roku OFF.
