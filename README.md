<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30498791/216785653-56f6e432-7f9b-46aa-99bd-f29ec84a48de.png" alt="Roku Remote Image">
<br>
<br>
Basic remote features offered:<br>
up, down, left, right, ok, home, play/pause, and back
<br>
<br>
This project should work on any platform, however the GUI will most
likely need adjustments if not using Windows.
<br>
<br>
Use the GUI's Edit button to store your Roku IP. Press Save after
entering the IP address.
<br><br>
Use your Roku's Network Settings panel to find the device's private IP address.
For most class C networks it will probably look similar to 192.168.1.XXX.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Other than Tkinter, there are no other requirements except for Python3.
